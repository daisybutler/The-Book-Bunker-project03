### Primary Goal

The primary goal of this website is to offer a comprehensive and curated directory of personal finance books. For example, a person interested in reading up about investing will not have to trawl through the thousands of books available online, with no way of knowing if a book is credible or useful, but rather can search a database of books approved by personal finance experts. You might think of The Book Bunker as a website applying regulations to personal finance literature. Since there is nothing to stop someone with no qualifications writing a book about personal finance, or someone rating it 5 star on goodreads.com because they thought it sounded legitimate, it would be very useful to have a collation of books that had been 'vetted' by experts in the field.

### User Profile

The ideal user of the website is someone who has an amateur interest in personal finance and financial wellbeing.

### Design Process

**UX Design**

1. Strategy Plane

In my research, I searched for a website that offers a comprehensive and easily searchable collection of personal finance and financial wellbeing books and there were none. The closest match I could find were online articles such as ['17 best personal finance books'](https://www.notion.so/Book-Bunker-README-md-0a1a4c4f2e7948c8a104bb43aa1f4387) and shortlists from companies of their best selling books, such as Amazon's ['Dummy Finance'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=dummies+finance&i=stripbooks&adgrpid=55820272240&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48bxh3cgKTNy7W1wXEPDBPiZhOH905f6iJ6C8axr1YC0ZOjpwqR8pUyYaAl2EEALw_wcB&hvadid=259077914612&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9045050&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=6563007144507394676&hvtargid=kwd-300672784782&hydadcr=18461_1772262&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd_sl_2o7e0kq9pg_b) range. While no doubt useful to some degree, these resources do not provide a wide selection of books nor do they take into consideration the expertise of authors etc. I concluded that a simple, one-stop database would be a time-saving and handy website for a great many people, rather then forcing them to trawl through articles and review sites, an undoubtedly laborious and often confusing task.

2. Scope Plane

Having identified this gap in the online personal finance market, I investigated the scope of creating a website to satisfy it. The primary feature and main attraction of the website would be the ability for a user to input a keyword and instantly access a curated library of book suggestions relating to it. Therefore, a search bar on the homepage and a search bar and book collection on an 'All Books' page are important, plus the group of books by keyword.

The secondary features of the website would be to create a more personal experience for the user and encourage them to revisit the website. The benefit of this from a business perspective would be to build a mailing list of people interested in finance and increase the likelihood of the user using an affiliated link on more than one occasion. Therefore, the user needed to have the option to login/signup for an account, have a space where they could save books they have found on the site which they want to read, and interact with other users in book discussions. These would be satisfied by the login/sign page, the 'My Library' page and the discussion board attached to each book.

3. Once I had decided on the features I wanted to include, I moved on to the structure. Out of personal preference, the website would be divided into separate pages, rather than one continuous page. These pages would be 'Home', 'All Books', 'Contact' and 'Login/Signup' for all users and 'My Library' and 'Log Out' (in place of 'Login/Signup') for existing logged in users only.

4. Skeleton Plane

Having planned out my structure, I created wireframes in Figma. (see wireframes). The 'Home' page would be the page the user lands on upon first visiting the site. The purpose of this page would be to fulfil the user's need of search for books, so the search bar should be the main focus along with brief site information and a call to action with login/sign up buttons. 

The 'All Books' page will also have a search bar at the top, and return a list of books relating to the keyword the user enters. If nothing has been searched for, a list of featured items will display. A user has the ability to click on the book to read more about it and add to reading list, heart and engage in a community discussion about it via a comment box.

The 'My Library' page is page which is only visible to a logged in user. The user can list books in this area they have found in their search across the site to a 'To Read' list. These will appear in a collapsible element. Books can be removed from the list, or marked as read and move them to a 'Read' list at the bottom fo their profile. The user can also manage their personal information such as email address and name  by accessing an unlinked 'Settings' page. 

The 'Contact' page contains a form where the user can send a question, suggestion or comment to the website owner. 

The finally menu item appears to those who have yet to login or signup as 'Login/Signup' and to those who have logged in as 'Log Out'. There will be a simple form for 'Name' and 'Password' and an additional 'Email' field for new users. Prompting buttons such as 'Already have an account?' and 'New here?' help the user navigate to the appropriate page.

5. Surface Plane

I wanted The Book Bunker's visual design to be light, clean and simple. This would important for a user who wants a simple method of getting the information they want as quickly as possible. Loud colours and complicated layouts would be counteractive to this. I'm an advocated for rounded edged to all shapes on websites because I think it effortlessly gives a modern and sleek feel.

This project has been imagined with a particular client in mind, who eventually might like to leverage this site as another way of growing their brand awareness. Therefore, my design reflects [their website](https://www.jason-butler.com) style and colour scheme, which is lilac, white, light grey and dark grey. PLEASE NOTE*: I designed, built and currently maintain this website - [jason-butler.com](http://jason-butler.com) - and all company branding associated with it.*

All these visual features and colours I experimented with and decided on in the creation of my wireframes in Figma (see Wireframes).

**Colours**

All pages comprise of these base colours:

- ![#BB98EB](https://placehold.it/15/bb98eb/000000?text=+) #BB98EB (lilac)
- ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.it/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) #FFFFFF (white)
- ![#DAD9D9](https://placehold.it/15/dad9d9/000000?text=+) #DAD9D9 (light grey)
- ![#282828](https://placehold.it/15/282828/000000?text=+) #282828 (dark grey)

**Fonts**

The fonts used in this project are "Poppins" for headings and "Lato" for paragraphs from Google fonts. All text has been assigned the generic font "sans serif" should Google fonts fail to load.

Sans serif fonts give the site a modern and sleek feel, while the specific choices from Google fonts are easy to read. The contrast between the bold weight of "Poppins" and the regular weight of "Lato" is a nice pairing to the eye.
