### Code Validation

- This project used the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate HTML code. The only errors returned which needed attention were a few incorrect uses of anchor tags and duplicate IDs, which were missed because they were in a Jinja for loop. Other errors raised were those thrown by the use of the Jinja templating language and the absence of a Doctype, since all pages are an extended from base.html. These errors were not thrown when the code was validated via a URL, but I had to use the direct input option for a few pages,  which did. Thus, these errors could be ignored. Only one validation screenshot has been attached for demonstration purposes, since there were too many to include every one.
